🧪 HealthNexus AI: Advanced Biometric Analytics SuiteHealthNexus AI is a professional-grade health monitoring dashboard designed to bridge the gap between raw biometrics and actionable physiological insights.👨‍🏫 Project GovernanceLearning Institution: Madrid software Academic Mentor: Surya pratap Lead Developer: Himanshu Ved Team Member: Roshan Kumar , Aditya 🚀 Key FeaturesDynamic UI: A fully reactive dashboard built with Streamlit that requires zero page reloads.Clinical Algorithms: * BMI: Standard Quetelet Index classification with visual color-coded feedback.BMR: Basal Metabolic Rate via the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation.IBW: Predictive modeling of Ideal Body Weight using the Robinson Formula.Interactive Analytics: Real-time Plotly gauge meters for instant health-status visualization.Global Accessibility: Full support for both Metric (kg/cm) and Imperial (lbs/in) systems.Nutrition Intelligence: Automated Macronutrient (Protein/Carbs/Fats) distribution based on activity coefficients.🛠️ Technical ArchitectureLanguage: Python 3.12Framework: StreamlitVisualization: Plotly JSON-based graphing engineData Processing: Pandas🧬 Scientific Methodology1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)We implemented the industry-standard Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:$$BMR = (10 \times weight) + (6.25 \times height) - (5 \times age) + s$$(Where $s$ is $+5$ for males and $-161$ for females)2. Ideal Body Weight (IBW)Using the Robinson Formula to determine weight targets based on biological gender:Male: $52kg + 1.9kg$ for every inch over 5 feet.Female: $49kg + 1.7kg$ for every inch over 5 feet.📦 Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/himanshuved2006-wq
